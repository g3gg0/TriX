*****************************************************************************
INSTALLING C2HTML version: 1.0.0 bèta
*****************************************************************************

This file describes how to install c2html.
At first we have to extract the c2html-package (.tar.gz file). Now there are
two required steps to install c2html left:
- compiling the program
- installing the program
Not a required, but however a recommended step, is cleaning (= removing
object files and the executable) the directory where we compiled the program.


COMPILING
=========

We compile c2html by running make:
	$ make
If you are running a system (like BSD) which uses cc instead of gcc, you
should run:
	$ make cc
And when you are using another compiler:
	$ make CC=<compiler>
Where <compiler> is the name of the compiler you are using.


INSTALLING
==========

Now we can install the program (under root), by running:
	$ make install
The program will be installed in /usr/local/c2html and a binary in
/usr/local/bin . To install the programm in a self-defined directory run:
	$ make install prefix=<directory>
After doing this, c2html is installed in <directory>/c2html and a binary in
<directory>/bin .


CLEANING
========

To delete the object files and executable in the current working directory,
run:
	$ make clean


UNINSTALLING
============

To remove c2html run:
	$ make uninstall
This undoes all effects of a previous 'make install'.
When c2html is not installed in the default directory (/usr/local), run:
	$ make uninstall prefix=<directory>
<directory> is the directory where c2html is installed in.
